The **Creosote** project brings the most powerful computational mathematics libraries to the Ruby ecosystem. It aids developers in installing individual math gems, such as **gmp** and **msieve**, and can bridge these libraries together at runtime.

The creosote aims to bring together as many mathematics packages as possible; the list will probably never stop growing. Here are the priorities:

* [GMP](http://gmplib.org/) - the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
* [MPFR](http://www.mpfr.org/) - the GNU library for "multiple precision floating-point computations with correct rounding"
* [msieve](http://sourceforge.net/projects/msieve/) - "a C library implementing a suite of algorithms to factor large integers"
* [GMP-ECM](http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr/) - Elliptic Curve Method for Integer Factorization
* [MPC](http://www.multiprecision.org/index.php?prog=mpc) - Multiple Precision Complex arithmetic
* [FLINT](http://www.flintlib.org/) - a Fast Library for Number Theory
